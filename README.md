PyBitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages. You need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities with decentralized BM. It uses strong authentication, which means that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide metadata, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those ongoing
warrantless wiretapping programs by spy agencies etc..

Development
----------
Bitmessage is a collaborative project.
